#***** Randomisation and Lists****************************


#modules is a way to split up the code and make it easier to understand

#here we import random module which is inbuilt in python
import random
# import my_module #this module is created by me and i have stored value of pi in the file and now i am using in this program

random_integar=random.randint(1,19) # here we are generating random number between 1 to 10 by random.randint() function 
random_float=random.random() #we are generating random float number between 0 to 1 by random.random() function 
randomfloat_to_five=random.random() *5 #we are generating random float number between 0 to 5 by random.random() function
print(random_integar)
print(random_float)
print(randomfloat_to_five)

# print(my_module.pi)

love_calculator=random.randint(1,100)
print(f"Your love score is {love_calculator}")



#*******************LISTS*****************************
#***********************Understanding the offsets and appending items to lists****************************

#list is called data structure, it is the way of organizing and storing  the data in python

#we can store the multiples data in a single variable such as  states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "New York"]
#In python, list always start with [ and end with ] and each item is seperated by ,
