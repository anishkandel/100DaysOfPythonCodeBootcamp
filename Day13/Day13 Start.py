# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# for loop in range (1, 20) is only taking value to i from 1 to 19

# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#the function is defined by my_function which only calls "you got it when i is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#value of i will be 1 to 19
